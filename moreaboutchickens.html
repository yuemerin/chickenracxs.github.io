            A chicken is a domesticated bird that belongs to the species Gallus gallus domesticus.
            Chickens are commonly raised for their meat and eggs and are one of the most widely kept and economically
            important poultry species worldwide.
            They are often kept on farms for egg production or raised for meat in the form of chicken (poultry) farming.
            Chickens are known for their social behavior, with a hierarchical structure within flocks.
            They have been selectively bred over thousands of years for various traits, leading to the development of
            different breeds with distinct characteristics, including size, color, and egg-laying abilities.
            Chickens are also popular as pets in some households, particularly certain breeds known for their friendly
            and docile nature. Overall, chickens play a significant role in agriculture, food production, and backyard
            farming.

        <h5>Diseases from Chicken</h5>
        <p>According to <a href="https://chat.openai.com/c/27cea18b-7094-475b-bd94-22dab5627cbc">Chatgpt, </a></p>
        <ol>
            <li bold><strong>Salmonella:</strong></li>
            <p>
                Raw or undercooked chicken is a common source of Salmonella bacteria, which can cause food poisoning.
                Symptoms include diarrhea, abdominal cramps, fever, and vomiting.
            </p>
            <li>Campylobacteriosis:</li>
            <p>
                Another bacterial infection, Campylobacteriosis, is often linked to undercooked chicken. Symptoms
                include diarrhea, abdominal pain, fever, nausea, and vomiting.
            </p>
            <li bold><strong>Clostridium perfringens</strong>:</li>
            <p>
                This bacterium can multiply rapidly in cooked chicken left at room temperature, leading to food
                poisoning. Symptoms include abdominal cramps and diarrhea.
            </p>
            <li bold><strong>Avian Influenza (Bird Flu): </strong></li>
            <p>
                Although rare, there have been cases of humans contracting avian influenza from infected poultry.
                This virus can cause severe respiratory illness and has the potential for outbreaks in poultry farms.
            </p>
            <li bold><strong>Escherichia coli (E. coli): </strong></li>
            <p>
                While E. coli is often associated with undercooked ground beef, it can also be present in raw chicken.
                Contamination can lead to symptoms such as stomach cramps, diarrhea, and vomiting.
            </p>
            <li bold><strong>Listeriosis:</strong></li>
            <p>
                Listeria monocytogenes, a bacterium that can be found in contaminated chicken, can cause listeriosis.
                Symptoms include fever, muscle aches, nausea, and diarrhea. Pregnant women, the elderly, and individuals
                with weakened immune systems are particularly vulnerable.
            </p>
            <p>
                To minimize the risk of contracting diseases from chicken, it's essential to follow proper food safety
                practices.
                This includes thorough cooking, avoiding cross-contamination, practicing good hygiene during food
                preparation, and refrigerating chicken promptly.
                Additionally, being aware of the source and quality of the chicken you consume can also contribute to
                food safety.
